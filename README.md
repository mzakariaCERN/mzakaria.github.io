# Hello!

My name is Mohammed Zakaria. I am a data scientist. I will use this page to post few projects that I am working on and some resources that I found usefull through my journey in the field of Data Science.

# Influencers in Data Science:  
1. Eamonn Keogh: Master of time series and clustering. No twitter handle. Checkout his website: https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/ A tresure!
2. Peyman Milanfar @docmilanfar. Nice posting about stats

# Good papers in Data Sciene:
1. https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/meaningless.pdf How clustering times series after applying a moving window filter is meaningless. Brilliant paper!
2. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12808.pdf Model Evaluation, Model Selection, and AlgorithmSelection in Machine Learning. Nice paper that covers the fundamentals.
